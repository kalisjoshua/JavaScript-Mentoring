# Refactoring - Martin Fowler

In chapter 1 of Martin Fowler's book 'Refactoring' a simple program is presented and refactored in a number of ways. The language of choice in the book is Java but here I attempt to present the examples in JavaScript. I also hope to take the refactorings a few steps further and even into the realm of Functional Programming.
