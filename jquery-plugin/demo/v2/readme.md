# Version 2

In this version we extend the previous with the feature of pausing and resuming the animation when a user hovers over or off of the plugin element.

*v1*
1. Add an image to the plugin element in the DOM
2. Load the first image in the list as the source of that image
3. Cycle through all images in the list
4. Do these steps for all plugin elements on the page

*v2*
1. When a user hovers over a plugin element, pause the animation
2. When a user moves the cursor off the element resume the animation
