# Version 1

In this version is a simplistic jQuery plugin with very few features and not much extensibility, but it accomplishes the goal of an element with an image being changed out with others.

*v1*
1. Add an image to the plugin element in the DOM
2. Load the first image in the list as the source of that image
3. Cycle through all images in the list
4. Do these steps for all plugin elements on the page
